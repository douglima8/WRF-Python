    "This library, despite being very useful, has not received updates since 2022. There have already been some discussions in the group about the reasons why there have been no updates. Due to this absence, it will have some dependencies that must be taken into account before its use (other libraries that must be used). For this reason, it is recommended to use an environment which contains the necessary versions of the libraries.\n",
